Deponia by [Daedalic Entertainment](https://www.daedalic.com/) is a point-and-click adventure game set in the junk planet Deponia. It was released on Jan 27, 2012.

The main character is Rufus, a slacker and tinkerer looking for better life away from the junkyard. The ultimate goal is to get to Elysium, perfect heaven to live in.

Deponia has great voice acting and humour. The puzzles make sense and there are enough hints in the game that the NGH guide can point the reader to before giving out the answer. Because of this it was quite easy to write the guides. The story advances so that all the puzzles happen in clear locations.

I have now provided guides to all Deponia series games ([1](https://nicegamehints.com/guide/deponia/),[2](https://nicegamehints.com/guide/chaos-on-deponia/),[3](https://nicegamehints.com/guide/goodbye-deponia/),[4](https://nicegamehints.com/guide/deponia-doomsday/)) for about a year.
I also collect site usage analytics and I can also see what Google searches lead to different guides. And constantly there is one page that is in the top of landing pages (so, the first page that is loaded) and in the top of Google search results.

And it is the [Golden Dragon of Invisibility](http://www.nicegamehints.com/guide/chaos-on-deponia/02-part-two/055-golden-dragon) guide from Chaos on Deponia game.

This picture shows that people look for, and luckily find, help in solving the puzzle.

And, if we don't count the guide root pages, Golden Dragon is the most common landing page from **all** games, take any time serie.

In the puzzle Rufus is supposed to get this Golden Dragon of Invisibility from an underground shop. The problem is that Shop-O-Mat, a robot clerk who has confisticated the original clerk, is watching closely what Rufus is doing. On top of that the Golden Dragon of Invisibility is... invisible! Though, it is, supposedly, standing on that stand.
Luckily, Rufus is allowed to test the other gadgets (not the Dragon!) before he decides to buy them. I won't tell more about the puzzle, but clearly players are having hard time with it.

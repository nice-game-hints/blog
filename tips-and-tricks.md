The most important thing about writing NGH hints is that they are actually _spoiler-free_.
Here are couple of tips to keep the hints free of spoilers.

## The title
Every guide (as we call a bunch of hints about a topic in NGH) has to have a title.
This is the title that is shown in the guide's parent subguide list. It is also shown in Google listings as the title of the page.
That is why the title should tell just enough that the player finds the correct guide but is not spoiled with the contents.
Some like to write the title as a question the player might ask. Others might just write what the title is about with one word.

Think also the title so that it could be as specific as possible. 
If the game deals with the topic in multiple parts of the game you should think the title so that the player does not "find" the guide too early.

I usually tilt the question to a topic. For example "How to find the potato?" becomes "Finding the potato"

Examples of good titles:
_How to find the potato?_
_Finding the potato_
_Potato_
_Getting into the room_
_Getting into the hotel room_

Examples of bad titles:
_Potato in the car_
_Getting the car in vain_
_Car is actually unlocked_

## The intro
Every guide can also have an intro. Do not tell anything spoiling there. The intro is shown in Google listings.
You can clear up the problem in the intro rewording what the player is looking for. This might be enough for the player in some cases.
But leave the actual hints to the hints.

## Other items
If your guide is about getting an item and the same place, that the player gets to open access to, contains other items leave them out.
I count that as spoiling that you say "oh, while you take the hammer, take the nails, also".
Maybe if it is just about picking up something you can tell about them. But only write the minimum hints to get what is the topic of the guide.

## Next steps
Avoid writing next steps into the hints. The player is interested getting the hammer. It might not be clear to them, yet, where to use the hamer.
By saying to the end something like: "Now you have the hammer. Go forth and hammer that house down." you actually spoil the game for the player.

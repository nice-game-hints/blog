VirtuaVerse by [Theta Division](https://www.thetadivision.com/) is a point-and-click adventure game set in the future featuring science fiction and cyberpunk elements. It was released on May 15, 2020.

In the game the main character Nathan is looking for his girlfriend Jay. Play out the game to find out rest of the plot.

Writing the guide for VirtuaVerse was quite clear. One annoying aspect of the game is that you have to go back and forth in the locations in some puzzles. There were also couple of pixel hunt style puzzles. And, on top of these, there were couple of cases where a thing appears to be clickable only after something else is first done. And that thing to do might be quite unrelated. So sometimes things unlock quite randomly. And that is hard from the guide writers perspective as I would need to somehow reason and hint the reader _why_ they need to do something first.

Overall the story is still nice and special plus from the music. You can read VirtuaVerse spoiler-free guide [here](http://www.nicegamehints.com/guide/virtuaverse/).

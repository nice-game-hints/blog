Night of the Rabbit by [Daedalic Entertainment](https://www.daedalic.com/) is a point-and-click adventure game telling the story of aspiring magician Jerermiah Hazelnut. It was released on May 28, 2013.

In the game the main character Jeremiah (Jerry) is sucked into the world of magicians and treewalkers.

Writing the guide for Night of the Rabbit was quite a similar experience from the Deponia series. The story is clearly splitted to different _chapters_ but the main location stays pretty much the same. That is a challenge when writing the guide as some of the puzzles didn't really need to be solved first time in the location. And players might be looking for hints to those too early. I hope I got the hints so that there is not too much of spoilers.
